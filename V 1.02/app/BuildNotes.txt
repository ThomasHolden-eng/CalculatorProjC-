This build now has the capability to handle floats (decimals) although they wer kind of buggy so I had to limit their use which I will try to fix in the next build
This build is ever so slightly larger than the previous build (2KB) but it is unlikely that this will affect load time, which is still virtually nonexistent
The interface of this build has also been enlargened
